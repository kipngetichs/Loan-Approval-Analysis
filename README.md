# Loan Approval Pattern Analysis
# Understanding What Drives Customer Loan Approvals — Insights & Solutions

# Situation
Banks review large volumes of loan applications every month. Approving high-risk applicants increases losses, while rejecting good borrowers reduces revenue. To support smarter, safer lending, I set out to answer one key question:

“What patterns exist among customers who get approved for loans?”

This understanding helps lenders refine risk assessment, approve the right customers, and minimize future losses.
# Task
My task was to turn raw loan data into clear, actionable insights. This meant:

- Cleaning and validating financial and credit records

- Comparing approved vs. declined applicants

- Identifying behavior patterns linked to safe borrowers

- Highlighting metrics lenders rely on to control risk

- Presenting findings in simple, business-focused language

The objective was to clearly define what a low-risk borrower looks like.
# Action

Using Power BI, I analyzed customer credit behavior, income stability, loan purpose, and risk signals. My approach included:

- Cleaning and organizing credit and financial fields

- Segmenting applicants by behavior, credit quality, and employment

- Visualizing approval patterns vs. rejections

- Studying risk indicators like defaults, delinquencies, and derogatory marks

- Evaluating income-related ratios

- Linking the insights directly to lending decisions

This helped uncover the strongest signals lenders rely on when approving customers.

# Results — Key Insights + What They Mean + Solutions
Below are the final insights, why they matter, and how lenders can use them to create value and solve business risk problems.
1. Approval Rate: 55%
- Insight: Slightly over half of applicants are approved.
- Meaning: Lenders are cautious but open — balancing business growth with risk control.
- Solution:Use this baseline to improve approval models, increasing good approvals while reducing bad ones.
2. Approved Customers Have Zero Defaults
- Insight: Not a single approved customer has a past default.
- Meaning: Defaults are an automatic risk blocker.
- Solution:Build automated rules that flag or block applicants with default history before manual review.
3. 94% of Approved Customers Have Zero Derogatory Marks
- Insight: Approved borrowers have very clean credit reports.
- Meaning: Serious credit violations strongly predict future repayment problems.
- Solution:Strengthen credit scoring models by giving higher weight to clean credit histories.
4. 73% Have Zero Delinquencies in the Last 2 Years
- Insight: Most approved borrowers consistently pay on time.
- Meaning: Recent payment behavior is one of the strongest predictors of future repayment.
- Solution:Introduce “recent payment behavior scoring” to reward consistent payers with faster approvals.
5. 69% of Approved Applicants Are Employed
- Insight: Employment dominates approved profiles.
- Meaning: Stable income reassures lenders that repayment is sustainable.
- Solution:Add employment stability scoring and incorporate job type as a risk-tiering factor.
6. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) is 0.24
- Insight: Approved borrowers have manageable debt relative to income.
- Meaning: Low debt burdens indicate room to take on new loans safely.
- Solution:Set a recommended DTI threshold (e.g., <0.35) to instantly screen applicants.
7. 50% of Approved Loans Are Credit Cards
- Insight: Half of approvals are small-risk credit card products.
- Meaning: Lenders use credit cards to test borrower behavior before offering bigger loans.
- Solution:Create “starter loan products” to reduce risk while nurturing long-term customer relationships.
8. Most Approved Customers Have Only 0–1 Year of Employment & Credit History
- Insight: Short histories are accepted when behavior is clean.
- Meaning: Creditworthiness is more about discipline than length of history.
- Solution:Enhance models to reward good behavior — not simply long credit timelines.
# Reflection
This project showed me how lenders combine data and risk thinking to protect their portfolio. I learned that behavior, not income, drives most approval decisions. Clean credit patterns—no defaults, no delinquencies, no derogatory marks—carry more weight than long employment history.

The analysis also proved how data solves business problems by revealing who is safe to lend to and why. Understanding these patterns allows any financial institution to improve approval accuracy, reduce losses, and grow responsibly.
